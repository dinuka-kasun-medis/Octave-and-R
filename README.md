# Octave-and-R
My laboratory lecture short note 
1.	3 Vs of Big Data
•	Volume
i.	Massive and keeps increasing volumes of data
•	Verity
i.	All type of different data as part of the decision-making and insight process
•	Velocity
i.	How quick data is arriving, stored and retrieved by users
2.	Data analysis 
•	is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision making.

3.	R language:
•	Case sensitive
4.	Octave:
•	GNU Octave is a high-level language
•	Octave is great for:
i.	Data Analytics
ii.	Machine Learning
iii.	Statistical Computations
iv.	Numerical Computations
v.	Advanced Graphing for data visualization and manipulation
•	Octave is written in C++ 
•	Can run MATLAB file also
•	Octave commands: 
i.	>>clc  clear command window
ii.	natural and base 10 logarithms  log(), log10()
iii.	square root sqrt()
iv.	built in functions:
1.	sin(pi/2)
2.	cos()
3.	tan()
4.	acos()  sin inverse
5.	asin() 

6.	round(2.4)
7.	floor(x)  return the largest integer not greater than x
8.	ceil(x)  Return the lowest integer not less than x
•	variables can consist with letters and numbers, but should start with letter
•	complex numbers:
i.	a=0+1*1i
ii.	b=1+2*1i


•	Matrix
i.	A=[12 30;42 45;12 1]
 
ii.	B= [1:4;5:8;9:12]
 
iii.	eye(3)  Identity matrix
iv.	inv(A)  Inverse of matrix
