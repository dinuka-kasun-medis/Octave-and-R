# Octave-and-R
My laboratory lecture short note 
1. **3 Vs of Big Data**
  - Volume
    1. Massive and keeps increasing volumes of data
  - Verity
    1. All type of different data as part of the decision-making and insight process
  - Velocity
    1. How quick data is arriving, stored and retrieved by users
2. **Data analysis**
  - is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision making.

3. **R language:**
  - Case sensitive
  
4. **Octave:**
  - GNU Octave is a high-level language
  - Octave is great for:
    1. Data Analytics
    2. Machine Learning
    3. Statistical Computations
    4. Numerical Computations
    5. Advanced Graphing for data visualization and manipulation
  - Octave is written in C++
  - Can run MATLAB file also
  - Octave commands:
    1. \&gt;\&gt;clc clear command window
    2. natural and base 10 logarithms log(), log10()
    3. square root sqrt()
    4. built in functions:
      1. sin(pi/2)
      2. cos()
      3. tan()
      4. acos() sin inverse
      5. asin()

      6. round(2.4)
      7. floor(x) return the largest integer not greater than x
      8. ceil(x) Return the lowest integer not less than x
  - variables can consist with letters and numbers, but should start with letter
  - complex numbers:
    i. a=0+1\*1i
    ii. b=1+2\*1i

  - Matrix
    I. A=[12 30;42 45;12 1]

    III. eye(3) Identity matrix
    IV. inv(A) Inverse of matrix
